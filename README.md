# pingdomPlayaround
fun test project

The project was built in an approach of enlarging not just focuses the current purposes, that's why it can seem to be overcomplicated structure

I it was not a special requirement I would use some built in template-model bindig instead of jquery, I would prefer knockout.js, what would ease the developement much more

The used chart util does not display the horizontal zones what would be nice to display the off and on statuses.
